          <p>Jimmy Carter was a peanut farmer, a Civil Rights activist, a state senator, a state governor, and a dedicated humanitarian. But he is best known for being the 39th president of the United States from the years 1977 to 1981.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, there are those who would consider his presidency to be unsuccessful, but there are many others who see him as the people's president, a man dissatisfied with the establishment and the status quo and willing to make long-term differences. During his time in the White House, Carter made many accomplishments such as pardoning citizens who refused to fight in the Vietnam War, starting the Department of Energy as well as the Department of Education, and creating a national energy policy that focused on conservation, price control, and new technologies. He even had solar water heating panels installed on the roof of the White House. Carter was also very well known for favoring diplomacy over violence throughout his career.</p>
          <p>Jimmy Carter also accomplished a great deal, post-presidency. He founded the <a href="https://www.cartercenter.org/" target="_blank">Carter Center</a> in 1982, a non-profit dedicated to protecting human rights, leading to him earning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his efforts with this organization. Carter also did a lot of work with the <a href="https://www.habitat.org/" target="_blank">Habitat for Humanity</a>, another non-profit focused on providing housing to low-income families. He is also the author of several books, including memoirs, poetry, and two books on the conflict between Israel and Palestine.</p>
          <p>Jimmy Carter is currently the longest lived US president in history, passing away at the age of 100 on December 29th, 2024. Let us hope that we see more leaders as principled and selfless as he was to carrying humanity towards a better future.</p>
